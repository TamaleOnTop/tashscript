Getting Started

The script is currently undergoing heavy obfuscation to ensure security. Once the process is complete, it will be available here on GitHub and in our dedicated Discord channel.

Key System

We utilize a weekly key reset system to maintain a secure community, providing better security compared to daily resets.

We are dedicated to providing the best experience and continually improving our features. Your suggestions are valuable to us, so please feel free to propose new ideas and improvements. As we grow, our commitment to quality and user satisfaction remains our top priority.
